        Description
      </h1>

      <p>
        This is the undertaker and social media influencer named Rambo from the planet Let It Rot. He is part of the underworld. After numerous injuries from constant fights he had to replace part of his body with an exoskeleton. However, it didn't help him. His arch-enemy dismembered him. After his death, Rambo's ghost got stuck in the cemetery, so he decided to work there as an undertaker and scare people. When the mouse moves vertically, he shakes his hands menacingly.

When the mouse moves horizontally vertically, he moves his lips.
When the mouse clicks, his magic hat changes color.

        Reflection
      </h1>

      <p>
        It was a surprise to me that the final design of the character was not ridiculous or illogical. I'm very happy that I got a unique and cute character that visually has its own distinct character, even without my invented story. During the creation of this sketch, I spent too much time coding hand and eyelid movements. It was important to me that the movements be completely consistent with my original idea. Because of this I had to do a lot of research. However, I am very happy with my final result.
