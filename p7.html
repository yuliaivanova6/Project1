      <p>
        Not long ago a friend of mine told me that I was stuck in Spanish-language playlists and that I needed to diversify my music preferences. At first I was negative about that comment. But then I thought it might be interesting to track what language occurs most often in my playlist. This chart contains information about the days of the week, the number of songs listened to per day and languages (English, Spanish, Russian, etc.). If you press the keys "S" for Sunday, "M" for Monday, "T" for Tuesday, "W" for Wednesday, you can see a list of songs listened to on that day.

        Well, my friend was right. The songs that I listen to are mostly in Spanish. However, that's what gives me genuine pleasure. That said, I'm always open to new musical discoveries in any other language. I am glad that halfway through the semester I finally have the skills I need to bring my ideas to life exactly the way I want it. While doing this assignment I encountered a difficulty: I don't know how to use the same array twice but with different length.
